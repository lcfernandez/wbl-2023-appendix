### Abstract

    This work is an appendix to the WBL'23 submission *A Tableaux System for Dolev-Yao Multi-Agent Epistemic Logic*, a theorem prover for the Dolev-Yao Multi-Agent Epistemic Logic. Our prover is based on tableaux method and we prove it sound and complete. Finally, we provide a termination argument for our method.
